I was very excited to work on this creation as we were going to really act in it and I was going to direct it. The story is about a man who is in search of his brother and wants to take revenge of the one who kills his family. The way in which he does this is the uniqueness of this movie.</p><p>We know some people working in the film industries, they helped us for providing the camera, lights, screens, audio system, etc. We planned the shooting and other things in a clear way and the record for everything we did was maintained. There were totally 21 people working in the movie. Besides this 21 many other were involved in acting.</p><p>I wanted the movie to be executed in a professional way. Before we started shooting we were doing trials for everything for 3 weeks. After that we started to shoot the film. We completed 50% shooting of the film and 20% editing of the film in February 2017.</p><p>We took the film very slowly because many were busy with their school and college. We had to shoot the film when we had free time.</p><p>We had planned to finish the movie in the summer vacation but due to my health problems the schedules were cancelled.</p><p>I hope that we will surely finish the movie in the upcoming years.</p></blockquote>

In the holidays of December 2016 we had to shoot some important scenes of the movie. We built a set of a laboratory in a big room. All the things in the room were fake. The whole background was green. Even the floor was green. We used Chroma Key technology to put up a lab scenario in the movie.</p><p>The way in which we shot in the set was almost looking like a professional movie making. The way all cooperated with each other was awesome.</p><p>Before one day of the shooting we imagined the scene of our shooting spot which was going to happen the next day. We visualized the spot and tried to find what mistakes we would do. The credit for this idea goes to our director. The way he imagines cannot be said in words. He can tell you the whole spot in just words and make you visualize the same. There was no mistake in any scenes as it was well planned. The lab scenes came very well.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p><strong>About our CEO</strong></p><p><strong>by Aparna</strong></p><p>Adhithiyan, CEO and founder of our company SabNic Studios. He is the head of our SabNic Family. All our creations and the idea for it is initiated by him. He his the one who develops the basic idea for the creation. He is involved almost in all the work. All the creations till now are named by him. He has written four stories till now. In short we can say that the company is nothing without him. The whole credit for all the creations goes to him.</p><p>The imagining ability he has cannot be expressed in words. Its just phenomenal. He visualises in such a way that if you ask how you visualise? you'll not believe in what he says. We came to know his true visualising power when he told us the story of the movie Dark.&nbsp;</p><p>He had the full movie in his mind. He had not written it, but was able to explain each frame to us. While telling the story he tells from which angle the camera would be and how it would look if it is shot from any other angle. We were astonished at seeing it. He tells what objects will be in the frame, what type of weather the environment will have and even what should be the background music and sound.</p><p>The way he visualises will make you try it!</p><p>He sits in front of a tv and sees the black screen for 20 to 30 minutes. He visualises the whole movie which he has in his mind. When he does this it looks like he is watching any programe in TV. If not TV he stands in front of the mirror. The closest friend of him the mirror. He talks to the mirror as if it has life and always stare at his own face. We don't know what he imagines but we also don't know how he is able to see the same thing for so much time.</p><p>We are very fortunate to have Adhithiyan as our CEO as his creative ideas and imagination has no limits. It has not only helped him but also us. Today we are very happy that we have created something which have helped others.</p><p>We will continue inventing more and more in future.</p><p>Here ends our #SABNICSTORY and we are eagerly waiting for your ones&nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;">:)</span></p><p>Thank You!</p></blockquote>
